**Overview**

This project aims to build a data pipeline that extracts past 24-hour weather data for specified locations, processes the data, and uses it to predict the next day's weather. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow, with Google Cloud Storage serving as the data storage solution and Google BigQuery for data analysis and prediction.

**Components**

ETL Process: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process is the core of the pipeline. It involves:

Extraction: Retrieving weather data for specified locations from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Transformation: Processing the raw data to extract relevant information and prepare it for analysis.
Loading: Storing the processed data in Google Cloud Storage and loading it into Google BigQuery for analysis.
Apache Airflow: Used for orchestrating the pipeline, scheduling tasks, and managing dependencies.

Google Cloud Storage: Serves as the intermediary storage solution for the processed weather data.

Google BigQuery: Used for storing, querying, and analyzing the weather data to make predictions for the next day's weather.

**Workflow**

The pipeline starts by extracting weather data for the specified locations using the OpenWeatherMap API.
The extracted data is then processed to format and clean it for analysis.
The processed data is stored in Google Cloud Storage and subsequently loaded into Google BigQuery.
Analysis and predictions are made based on the past 24-hour weather data to forecast the next day's weather.
Usage
To use this pipeline, you need to set up Apache Airflow, Google Cloud Storage, and Google BigQuery. You also need to provide a list of locations for which you want to fetch weather data. The pipeline can be scheduled to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily) to continuously update the weather predictions.

**Setup**

Environment Setup:

Create a virtual environment and activate it.
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Google Cloud credentials and export the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable.
Airflow Configuration:

Initialize the Airflow database: airflow db init
Start the Airflow webserver and scheduler.
BigQuery Setup:

Create a dataset and table in BigQuery to store the processed weather data.

**Running the Pipeline**

Access the Airflow web interface and trigger the load_weather_data DAG.
Monitor the DAG execution and view the logs for each task.
Check the BigQuery table to verify that the weather data has been loaded successfully.


**Conclusion**

This weather data pipeline project demonstrates how to leverage cloud services and data orchestration tools to build a scalable and automated system for weather data analysis and prediction.
